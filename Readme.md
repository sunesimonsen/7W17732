- Start application
In this step we will start the application by requiring the 
Application Router using Require.js and start backbone history tracking.

Notice that index.html has a reference to require.js with a data-main attribute 
pointing to the application entry point.

    <script data-main="resources/js/app" src="resources/jslibs/require.js"></script>

- Make router redirect to login if not authenticated


Integrate with Spring Security to log into backend
